 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * 
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * 
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or
 * lower.
 * 
 * You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results
 * (-1, 1, or 0):
 * 
 * 
 * -1 : My number is lower
 * ⁠1 : My number is higher
 * ⁠0 : Congrats! You got it!
 * 
 * 
 * Example :
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 * Output: 6
